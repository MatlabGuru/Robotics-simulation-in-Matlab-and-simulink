Two-Wheeler Robot Control Simulation Using MATLAB & Simulink
This project showcases the simulation of a two-wheeler robotic system in MATLAB and Simulink, featuring three distinct control strategies for comparison and analysis. 
Three robots were modeled: one controlled using a classic PID controller, another using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and the third operating with a hardcoded logic for predefined path tracking.
The PID-controlled robot follows a feedback-based approach for path correction, while the ANFIS-based robot leverages machine learning to adapt and improve its performance over time. The hardcoded robot, in contrast, executes fixed movements without dynamic feedback. 
This setup allowed for detailed performance comparison in terms of path accuracy, adaptability, and response to disturbances. 
The project highlights my ability to integrate traditional, intelligent, and rule-based control systems within a unified simulation environment, emphasizing strengths in control engineering, fuzzy systems, and robotics modeling.
